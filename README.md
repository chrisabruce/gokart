# gokart
Self driving car software

## Project
This project is my attempt at porting the
[DonkeyCar](https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey) to Rust.

### Why Rust?
Rust has a lot of potential for Robotics and Embedded systems.  Although this
software is designed to run on Raspi, there are still some benefits from using a
safe and high-performance language.  Additionally, this is a fun project for me
to learn Rust.
